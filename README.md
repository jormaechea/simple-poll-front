## About the app

Simple Poll is an open source solution to easy feedback. It also offers a free hosted instance in case you don't want to host your own.

The app is as simple as it can be. Just login, create your poll and get one-click feedback.

Whether you just made a presentation at work or you want to know what your friends and family think about your side project early stages, Simple Poll is a perfect fit for you.

Even Simple Poll gathers feedback about itself [here](https://simplepoll.jormaechea.com.ar/poll/5f023796fb53a40012455262?utm_source=readme_bottom&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=feedback)!

## About this repo

This repo contains the frontend of Simple Poll. You can see the Serverless backend in it's own [repo](https://github.com/jormaechea/simple-poll-api).

This may not be the best version of what it can be, but it's definitely a proof that this can be easily achieved.
